# To discover application names, see https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap/tree/v0.8.6#x11-1

# If you have problems, print keystrokes by running with: RUST_LOG=debug xremap wordstar.yml

# Bouncekeys note: this has been optimised to work with bouncekeys by avoiding
# key sequences that output repetitions of the same keystroke as bouncekeys suppress
# such keys (even control keys) iff bouncekeys is enabled after xremap is run.
